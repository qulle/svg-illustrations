# SVG Illustrations

A portfolio containing some of my SVG illustrations. I might release the SVG codes in the future but for now i have decided to only show the illustrations as PNG sprites. All illustrations are drawn using [Figma](https://www.figma.com) and is available in vector- and raster formats (SVG, PNG, JPG, PDF). Individual parts, like the windmill, helicopter etc, is also available as separate files.

## Nautical theme

## Cities and houses

## Countryside
