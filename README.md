# SVG Illustrations

A portfolio containing some of my SVG illustrations. I might release the SVG codes in the future but for now i have decided to only show the illustrations as PNG sprites. All illustrations are drawn using Figma and is available in vector format. Individual parts, like the windmill, helicopter etc, is also available as separate files.

## Nautical theme

## Cities and houses

## Countryside
